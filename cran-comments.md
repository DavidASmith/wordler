## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added return value documentation for all exported function.
* Explicitly defined and documented a "wordler" class to represent game state.
* Documented how functions modify the wordler object as the game progresses.

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
