Description: An R implementation of the 'Wordle' game. Players have six attempts 
    to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the player is informed which 
    letters in their guess are either: anywhere in the word; in the right 
    position in the word. This can be used to inform the next guess. Can be 
    played interactively in the console, or programatically.
